This is the "Roman math" from the Check tutorial.

This demonstrates using Check along with one of one build systems:
autotools
========================
Autotools:

You need the following programs installed on your system:
  -- Autoconf 2.59
  -- Automake 1.9.6
  -- Libtool 1.5.22
  -- Check 0.9.9

Somewhat earlier versions of these programs might work.

Then, do as follows:

$ autoreconf --install
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check

Don't do "make install" unless you want to install the roman math.

Roman_Math.c and Roman_Math.h are built as a library.  src/main.c:main() is a
client of libRoman_Math.la, just as tests/Roman_Math_test.c:main() is a client
of libRoman_Math.la

To use the autotools example in another project, start with the following
files:

   example
   |--- configure.ac
   |--- Makefile.am
   |--- src
   |    |--- Makefile.am
   |--- tests
        |--- Makefile.am
